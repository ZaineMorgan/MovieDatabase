    <h3>Zoe Saldana Joins the Voice Cast of 'My Little Pony: The Movie'</h3>
    <p>
        Hasbro and Lionsgate have signed Zoe Saldana for the voice cast of the animated &ldquo;My Little Pony: The Movie,&rdquo;
        Variety has learned exclusively. Previously announced voice cast members include Sia, Liev Schreiber, Taye Diggs,
        Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Michael Pena. Lionsgate is releasing &ldquo;My Little Pony&rdquo;
        on Oct. 6, 2017. Jayson Thiessen is directing from a screenplay by Meghan McCarthy, writer and producer of the &ldquo;My
        Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&rdquo; animated series. Jamie Foxx Still Claiming Martin Scorsese Will Direct A
        Mike Tyson Biopic While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule, it might have opened up slightly given
        the recent revelation that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director&rsquo;s next picture is expected
        to be the hitman tale &ldquo;The Irishman,&rdquo; which will reteam him with his longtime friend Robert De Niro,
        but according to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.
